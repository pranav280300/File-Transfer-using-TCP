# File-Transfer-using-TCP
you will learn how to perform a file (data) transfer over a TCP socket in C programming language. You will see how a client reads the data from a text file sends it to the server and then saves the data back into a text file.


Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.
